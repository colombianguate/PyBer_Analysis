# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Created a sumary DataFrame of PyBer by city type. Then using Pandas and Matplotlib, I created a multiple-line graph tha shows the total weekly fares for each city type. By creating this DataFrame it will share insight on how it can be used for the decision-makers at PyBer.
